# Inviso Macros

## Adding a new macro: 

- Get [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) on a remote, and log in with your GitHub account. 
- Clone this repository to your personal Y: drive.
- Create a folder with your macro's name in the `Macros` folder and keep all your work in that folder. 
- Keep all dependencies as "relative".
- Temporary files and assisting macros should be in the `AssistingMacros` folder. 
- When saving an assisting macro, use the `.yxmcbatch` extension. You can still import it into Alteryx, but it won't show up in the tool palette.
- **Remember to edit your macro's meta info**: in the Tool Palette section, use "Inviso Macros" in the Category Name field.
- Personalize the logo of your macro.
- Push to Github! 

If you follow these rules, magic will happen and your macro will be automatically included in the [Inviso Macro Pack](http://inviso.dk/macros) and in our Alteryx installations on the remotes.
